# Testing

**Responsiveness**

The responsiveness of all pages was tested on various screen sizes starting from 320px and above, as per the guidelines of WCAG 2.1 Reflow for responsive design on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Opera browsers. The [Website Responsive Test](https://websiteresponsivetest.com/) was used for this purpose, which offered various emulated mobile devices such as Samsung and Apple smartphones with different screen sizes. In addition to this, Google Chrome developer tools was used.

To test:
1. Open a browser and go to Link Autos Ireland website.
2. Right-click and select "Inspect" to open the developer tools.
3. Change the view to "responsive" and decrease the width to 320px.
4. Set the zoom to 50%.
5. Increase the width of the responsive window to its maximum.

Expected Result:
- The website should be responsive on all screen sizes, with no stretched or pixelated images.
- There should be no horizontal scrolling.
- No elements should overlap.

Actual Result:
- However at 320px the nav bar hamburger menu stop working, made adjustments to css then repeated all above tests.
- Titels in showroom appear broken at 320px, styling added to fix these
- Once fixes were applied The website performed as expected.

**Accessability**

The website was tested using the [Wave Accessability Toolt](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool to make sure it met certain accessibility standards. The focus was on ensuring that all forms were easily accessible, with clear labels or descriptions for screen readers. Color contrasts met the minimum requirements set by the WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines, and the headings were in the correct order to properly convey the importance of the content. All the content was organized into sections, so it was easy to navigate with assistive technology. Any non-text content had descriptive text or titles, and the HTML page language was set correctly. The website was also checked to make sure that the Aria properties were used correctly and that it followed the best coding practices for WCAG 2.1.

- The contrast of the website was flagged as an error during accessibility testing, but it was difficult to find color combinations that were not too dark and would fit with the design of the website. The color was eventually changed to a dark red, which still flagged an error, but it provides good visual contrast.
